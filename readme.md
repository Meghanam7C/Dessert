Our resident Theme Park expert  had this to say about the Ronto Wrap: I cannot stress this enough: I love the Ronto Wrap. The wrap comes to you blazing hot in a perfectly grill-marked pita. There are so many salty and spicy things to take
in at once, it almost makes you want to slow down for a bit and compartmentalize every bite. Crunchy and well-dressed slaw? Yes. Lush slices of roasted pork? Yes. The absolute perfect amount of snap upon that first bite of sausage? Yes! There is not a single part of this meal thatâ€™s not joyful.
